When changing the train-dev files make sure to overwrite the cached files!!!
Otherwise the changes are not properly applied

 Initialize model from biobert!!!


Now we have biobert self-fine-tuned on Squad v1.1 
Also fine tune biobert on squad v2.0

Next we need to train the NER head on  some task?? hmm
is it possible to add a new head? Yes, I think so
I think ner head is already included, right?
